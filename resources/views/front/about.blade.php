							Hello, I welcome you all to my blog where I regularly post my finest tutorials of PHP, Android, JavaScript, Laravel, HTML, MySQL, CSS, JQuery and laravel Apiâ€™s for beginners. I have been employed as a web developer since 2015, where I worked extensively on numerous national and international projects. Recently I have decided to share my knowledge and experience with everyone who is interested in web development or starting a new voyage in this ever evolving field. I also hope that this blog will serve those people who are looking towards some solutions for their web applications.
						</p>
